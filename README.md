# Ironsworn for Foundry VTT

This is an implementation of the [Ironsworn](https://www.ironswornrpg.com/) rule set for Foundry VTT.
It's based on the [Simple Worldbuilding System](https://gitlab.com/foundrynet/worldbuilding) that Atropos has kindly provided.

To install it, plug this URL into the install UI:

```

```

## THIS IS PRE-RELEEASE SOFTWARE

Not everything works, and what does only _barely_ works.
There's a [to-do list issue](https://github.com/ben/foundry-ironsworn/issues/2) if you're interested in helping out.
